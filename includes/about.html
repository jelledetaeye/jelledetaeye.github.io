		<p><strong>Hello World!</strong></p>
		<p>My name is Jelle, I'm from Europe (Canary Islands is home) but I currently live in San Francisco.
			During the weekdays I spent most of my time <a href="https://radius.com/" target="_blank"><strong>@Radius</strong></a>
			where I brew coffee and tell computers what to do.
			During the weekends I try to explore the city or go backpacking.
